"Circular Multilateral Barter" (CMB) is aimed at supplying entrepreneurs with a way to exchange goods and services within a p2p-network, without using money, overcoming the "double coincidence of wants" problem, inherent to traditional barter.  Most importantly, CMB allows traders to issue their own currencies (called "products"), which others can redeem, trade, or make payments with.  One thing that distinguishes CMB from other "credit commons" is that all debts in CMB are user-to-user debts. There is no central administrative authority to decide who deserves to be trusted and who does not. Because of this, CMB can scale-up very well, so that local communities can be seamlessly aggregated into larger ones.  Another way of seeing CMB is as a partnership of independent Local Exchange Trading Systems, having a common marketplace for exchanging one LETS-currency for another (via circular trade).
