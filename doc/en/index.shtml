<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">What is &quot;<span class="ssi"><!--#echo var="HTTP_HOST" --></span>&quot;?</a></h1>
<p><span class="ssi"><!--#echo var="HTTP_HOST" --></span> is an open platform for
<strong>circular barter exchange</strong> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id1">[1]</a>.  It gives you the concreteness of
ordinary two-person barter along with the flexibility of being able to
give to and receive from two different people.  That is: you supply
goods <em>to customers who trust you</em>, and you receive goods <em>from
partners whom you trust</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-barter">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Why barter?</a></h2>
<p>Barter can facilitate trade even when cash flow is tight.  People are
interested in trading products (goods and services) for other products
even when they can not afford to buy the products with money.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-circular">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Why circular?</a></h2>
<p>Conventional two-way barter can only happen when there is a
coincidence of wants: &quot;A&quot; wants what &quot;B&quot; has while at the same time B
wants what A has.  Circular barter allows for a lot more flexibility:
A wants what B has; B probably wants what someone else has, and that
person in turn probably wants what a fourth person has.  Eventually
it's likely that the chain will loop back on itself, so that a
circular trade can be arranged:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="diagrams/circular-trade.jpg" src="diagrams/circular-trade.jpg" />
</div>
<p>In a circular trade, you know exactly what you're going to receive and
exactly what you're going to give.  The products are not actually
delivered at the same moment, but <em>the deal is made in one instant</em>:
the agreement to deliver one product, and the agreement to receive
another product.  Where, when, and how the actual delivery of goods
will happen depends on the concrete arrangements you make with each
one of your partners.  Remember, you should choose people you trust as
your partners!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-does-it-work-in-practice">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">How does it work in practice?</a></h2>
<p>Although, in theory, with <span class="ssi"><!--#echo var="HTTP_HOST" --></span> the
lack of money shouldn't be a problem at all, in reality, you often
need certain products right away, so you can't wait for a circular
deal to happen. In order to avoid needlessly spending your money, you
should, in advance, collect delivery promises for sufficient amounts
of these products that you are likely to need in the near future. That
is: <em>you buy a bulk of products which you, later on, receive in
portions.</em> If you do so, your partners will be committed to provide
you with the goods and services you need, at the moment you need them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-there-is-more">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">But there is more!</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can make payments to other users, transferring to them products
that you own.</li>
<li>You can sell back products that you have bought if you do not need
them anymore.</li>
<li>You can send messages to your customers, as well as receive messages
from your partners.</li>
<li>You can use <span class="ssi"><b><!--#echo var="HTTP_HOST" -->/mobile/</b></span> from
any Internet-connected cell phone.</li>
<li>You can start a local exchange trading system.</li>

<div class="section" id="using-the-system">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">Using the system</a></h1>
<p>We did our best to make the system easy to use.  Nevertheless,
having a quick introduction to the key concepts will make you much
more confident when you buy and sell things in the system.  Notice
that when we say &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;sell&quot;, it really means &quot;receive&quot; and
&quot;deliver&quot;, because no money actually changes hands.</p>
<div class="section" id="advertising-your-trader-id">
<span id="my-business-card"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Advertising your trader ID</a></h2>
<p>A unique trader ID is automatically generated for every user.</p>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h3>My business card</h3>
<p>To find out what your trader ID is, click the &quot;My business card&quot; link
in the main menu:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="diagrams/my-business-card.jpg" src="diagrams/my-business-card.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Your ID will show up at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Make sure your customers will be able to find your trader ID too: put
it on your real business card, put it on your website, put it in your
ads <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id3">[2]</a>.  Knowing your trader ID is the easiest way for your
potential customers to find you in the system!</p>
<p>If you are the sole proprietor of your business, make sure you have
uploaded your photograph to your business card, so that your trading
partners can confirm that they are delivering goods to the right
person.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="putting-your-products-on-the-market">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22">Putting your products on the market</a></h2>
<p>First, you have to create a list with all the products that you offer
together with their respective prices. When this is done, you should
register your spare items for sale.</p>
<p><strong>Important notice:</strong> In your pricelist, you should list only products
that are suitable for use as currency.  That is: people have to be
willing to buy your product, or be paid with it, over and over.  &quot;My
old laptop&quot;, for example, isn't a good product, because it represents
a single indivisible item.  &quot;Music lessons&quot;, on the other hand, can be
an excellent product, as long as there is at least one person willing
to buy it, or be paid with it.  If you do not offer products suitable
for use as currency â€” leave your pricelist empty <em>(In this case, you
will still be able to make and receive payments in other people's
products, as well as to exchange one product for another via circular
deals)</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="create-a-product">
<h3>Create a product</h3>
<p>To define a new product, click the &quot;My pricelist&quot; link in the main
menu, then click &quot;ADD PRODUCT&quot;:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="diagrams/create-product.jpg" src="diagrams/create-product.jpg" />
</div>
<p>On this page you can describe your new product, so that your customers
know what they are going to receive.  Click &quot;Submit&quot; to add the
product to your pricelist.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id4">
<span id="my-pricelist"></span><h3>My pricelist</h3>
<p>To see your current offers, click the &quot;My pricelist&quot; link in the main
menu: (The examples shown here are for someone who has already
participated in a trade.)</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="diagrams/my-pricelist.jpg" src="diagrams/my-pricelist.jpg" />
</div>
<p>Here you can update the prices of your products.  Although the prices
given here are in U.S. dollars, <em>you should put your prices in the
currency that is used in your country</em>.</p>
<p>Take a look at the &quot;Available amount&quot; column â€” it tells you the total
amount of product that you need to keep in stock, or otherwise be able
to deliver.  Click on the product's name to see all the customers to
whom you agreed to deliver this product together with the agreed
(deposited) amounts:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="diagrams/my-product.jpg" src="diagrams/my-product.jpg" />
</div>
<p>On this page you can see that you owe 20 pieces of your &quot;Product A&quot; to
a customer with trader ID &quot;958770802&quot;. You can also see that there are
80 spare pieces of this product that you currently offer for sale.
Look at the &quot;Roundoff amount&quot; number in product's description â€” for
your convenience, product amounts are rounded off according to this
number.</p>
<p>If there are no deposited items for a product, a check-box will show
up here instead, allowing you to delete the product.  The next
section, &quot;My items for sale&quot;, will explain how to increase the
&quot;deposited amount&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-items-for-sale">
<span id="my-items"></span><h3>My items for sale</h3>
<p>After you have at least one product in your pricelist, click the &quot;My
items for sale&quot; link in the main menu to register your spare items for
sale:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="diagrams/my-items.jpg" src="diagrams/my-items.jpg" />
</div>
<p>This page tells you one more time that you have 80 pieces of your
&quot;Product A&quot; for sale. To increase this amount click on &quot;MAKE A
DEPOSIT&quot;; to decrease this amount click on &quot;withdraw&quot;.  When you list
items on &quot;My items for sale&quot;, you should set aside that amount of
stock of actual goods, or otherwise ensure that you will be able to
deliver that amount of a product if required.</p>

<span id="my-partners"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">Deciding which products you want to buy</a></h2>
<p>In order to buy from people, first you have to list them as your
partners to indicate that you trust them.  Then you will be able to
view your partners' offers, and from there, to add products to your
shopping list.  Finally, you have to define in your shopping list the
exact amounts which you want to buy.</p>
<div class="section" id="id5">
<h3>My partners</h3>
<p>To add someone to your list of partners, click the &quot;My partners&quot; link

<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id6">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>To view your partners' offers, go to &quot;My partners&quot;, then click on the

is shown at the bottom of every page.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="diagrams/next-turn.jpg" src="diagrams/next-turn.jpg" />
</div>
<p>During a trading turn the system analyzes all users' offers and bids.

<p><strong>Important notice:</strong> You need to have a way to reimburse your
customers for any fractional amounts that they may have bought, which
are impossible to be delivered directly (0.25 bicycles for example).
In such cases, you can deliver some amount of other goods or services;
or you can give or receive some amount of money, so as to get rid of

your &quot;shopping list&quot; to other users' shopping lists.  It is very
similar to a bank transfer â€” you instruct your partner (the bank) to
transfers the ownership of some of your goods to someone else.</p>
<p>Although, in many ways, <span class="ssi"><!--#echo var="HTTP_HOST" --></span>'s

<li>The type of goods that are transferred (the medium of exchange)
should not necessarily be money. Payments can be made in every
convenient product that the payer owns, which the payee happens to
appreciate.</li>
<li>All payments should be explicitly confirmed by the payee before
being carried out.  This allows for simple, reliable, and
