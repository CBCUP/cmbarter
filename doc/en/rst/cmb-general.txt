The idea in brief
=================

In this document we propose a novel system for trading of goods which
we call "Circular Multilateral Barter" (CMB).  The following diagram
illustrates the idea at a glance::

                      rice                      apples

 |                                                                      |
 |                                                                      |
 |                                 plums                                |

The problem
===========

There is one very simple problem hindering trade more than anything
else:

  *When traders deliver goods to buyers, they must somehow obtain
  trustworthy guarantees for repayment.*

The problem is so obvious that it remains largely unspoken.
Nevertheless there are several quite well-known approaches for solving
it:

`Barter:`_
  The seller instantly obtains goods of equivalent value from the
  buyer.

  Although ideal in some ways when it can be arranged, this method is
  limited to situations where a `double coincidence of wants`_ occurs.

`Commodity money:`_
  The seller obtains an equivalent amount of some globally scarce good
  (such as gold).  The seller is confident that she will be able to
  exchange it for something else in future as long as that good is in
  short supply globally.

  This approach limits the amount of goods that traders are able to
  exchange since the amount of globally scarce goods is limited.
  Another disadvantage is that the good's natural value is distorted,
  leading to inefficiencies of use, and its value can also be
  manipulated by `cornering the market`_, giving unfair advantages to
  some while others pay the costs.

`Fiat money:`_
  The seller obtains a specific type of globally scarce good: money.
  The principal difference here compared to commodity money is that
  the money supply can be manipulated by dedicated authorities.

  With the use of fiat money trading should be, at least in theory,
  less limited by money scarcity than it is with commodity money.
  Unfortunately in practice this is not always the case.  Another
  practical problem with this approach is that the value of money
  becomes even more susceptible to manipulation.

The sustainable solution
========================

In a circular transaction every seller is a buyer too.  Therefore the
seller instantly obtains guarantees for repayment from a trusted
supplier (assuming that traders choose suppliers they trust).
Normally suppliers of goods have to trust their recipients in order to
be repaid.  CMB effectively reverses the direction of trust, making
the use of money as a medium of exchange unnecessary.  CMB's approach
has three principal advantages compared to other means of trading:

* CMB does not suffer the `double coincidence of wants`_ problem.  The
  trader you deliver goods to and the trader you obtain what you need
  from do not need to be the same person, so there is much more
  flexibility for arranging trades.

* In CMB, trading is not limited by the global scarcity of any good.

* CMB uses money solely as a `standard of value`_ for a short period
  of time (typically a day).  Thus CMB is insusceptible to changes in
  the value of money.

The obvious disadvantage of CMB is that the process of arranging
circular transactions (waiting for a multiple coincidence of wants to
occur) requires time.  We believe often the advantages of CMB will
make it worthwhile in spite of such delays.

How it works
============

The whole trading process is quite straightforward.  When a buyer and
a seller agree to trade a certain amount of a product at a given
price, they register their agreement into a central database (see `The
coordinating system`_).  Overnight the database is analyzed and a list
is issued of circular transactions that are discovered.  The traders
themselves are responsible for the actual carrying out of the
transactions [1]_.

.. [1] When a buyer and seller digitally sign a delivery agreement,
   they are making a commitment to each other to carry out that
   transaction if it's included in a trading cycle issued by the
   coordinating system.


The coordinating system
-----------------------

`The coordinating system` (or simply `coordinator`) is a computer
system that organizes traders to engage in circular transactions.  The
coordinator does so by executing `trading turns`_ on a regular basis.
The coordinator may decide to execute trading turns during periods of
weak trading activity in order to allow traders to put their goods in
other markets also.

Running a coordinating system is a serious responsibility that must be
appointed to trustworthy individuals or organizations.  The
coordinator's software must digitally sign all documents it issues so
that traders can verify the contents indisputably.  Strong computer
security is needed.


Trading turns
-------------

A `Trading turn` is a successive completion of the following tasks:

1. Collecting `delivery agreements`_ from traders.

2. Building a `directed graph`_ representing collected delivery
   agreements [2]_ and analyzing it to discover cycles (circular
   transactions).

3. Issuing a `trading report`__ containing circular transactions that
   are found.

Trading turns should be announced beforehand by publishing a digitally
signed document, constructed in accordance with a particular `regular
language grammar`_, containing the following information:

+ *turn ID*

  An unique identifier for the trading turn.

+ *collection starting time*

  The time at which the collection of delivery agreements begins.

+ *collection deadline*  

  The time at which the collection of delivery agreements ends.

+ *report deadline*
  
  The time at which the trading report is expected to be issued.

+ *previous turn ID*

  The `turn ID` of the previous turn.  All trading turns should be
  lined up in a `singly-linked list`_ with the most recent turn
  corresponding to the head of the list.


.. _singly-linked list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list
.. _directed graph: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(mathematics)
.. [2] In such a graph each trader becomes a vertex and each
   delivery agreement becomes a directed edge going from the seller to
   the buyer.


Delivery agreements
-------------------

In the context of CMB, a `delivery agreement` (DA) is an agreement
between two traders (buyer and seller) for the seller to deliver a
certain amount of a given product or service, valued at a given price,
to the buyer, under the coordinator's guidance.  The price is just a
measure of value; no money actually changes hands in the transaction.

Delivery agreements must be constructed in accordance with a
particular regular language grammar, be digitally signed by both
seller and buyer (see `Delivery agreement signing protocol`_), and
contain the following information:

+ `turn ID`

  Announced by the coordinator beforehand.  All circular transactions
  must be constituted entirely of delivery agreements having the same
  `turn ID`.

+ `coordinator's public key`

  See `public key cryptography`_.

+ `buyer's public key` and `seller's public key`

  In CMB, traders' public keys serve as a form of identification.  All
  traders must have generated their own cryptographic key pairs.
  Traders should keep their corresponding private keys in secret.

+ `buyer's flow ID` and `seller's flow ID`

  Using more than one flow ID allows a trader to participate as if
  they are more than one different individual. This allows them
  flexibility to constrain which of their goods they trade for which
  other goods.  Delivery agreements with the same public keys but
  different flow IDs must be treated by the coordinator as if they are
  referring to different traders.

+ `product or service identifier`

  A string identifying the product or service to be delivered.  All
  details concerning the content of the string are to be worked out
  bilaterally between the buyer and the seller.  Traders may settle on
  a particular format to specify the price, the unit of measurement,
  the terms and conditions etc. of the product or service in question.

+ `maximum value to deliver`

  The seller must be willing to deliver any amount from 0 up to the
  `maximum value to deliver`.  Accordingly the buyer must be willing
  to receive any amount from 0 up to the value listed.  All traders in
  the system must specify this field in the same measurement units.
  Those units should be decided and announced beforehand by the
  coordinator.

  Traders should agree on alternatives to cover any impossible
  fractional goods that might occur.  For example: "up to $1000 of
  goats, but if I owe you a fraction of a goat I'll give you apples
  instead for that fractional goat, at the rate of 5 bushels of apples
  per goat."

  If two or more delivery agreements differ only in their `maximum
  value to deliver`, being otherwise identical, the biggest value is
  the one that matters (values don't sum up).

Delivery agreement signing protocol
-----------------------------------

Delivery agreements have to be digitally signed by both traders before
being sent to the coordinator.  Buyers and sellers may use the
following simple protocol in order to generate signed agreements:

"Want to sell" request: 
  Issued by the seller.  Consists of the proposed `DA's content`__.
  Optionally includes the seller's digital signature of DA's content.

  Possible responses to this request are:

  - `rejected` (includes rejection reason)
  - `accepted` (includes buyer's digital signature of DA's content)
  - `value is too big`  (includes maximal acceptable value)

"Want to buy" request:
  Issued by the buyer.  Consists of the proposed `DA's content`__.
  Optionally includes the buyer's digital signature of DA's content.

  Possible responses to this request are:

  - `rejected` (includes rejection reason) 
  - `accepted` (includes seller's digital signature of DA's content)
  - `value is too big` (includes maximal acceptable value)


Trading reports
---------------

The coordinating system must at the end of each trading turn issue a
report describing all transactions it has issued for the turn.  The
entire report must be digitally signed by the coordinator's software
so that it's verifiable that no changes or additions have been made.
The coordinating system must provide all the means for traders to
obtain those parts of the report which concern them directly.

Each trading report should consist of the following entities:

+ one `index document`_
+ zero or more `engagement documents`_
+ zero or more `circular transaction documents`_

Each of these documents should be constructed in accordance with a
particular regular language grammar, be digitally signed by the
coordinator's software, and refer to its corresponding `turn ID`__.

To respect traders' privacy, the coordinator should only reveal
information when there is a strong reason to do so.  Trading reports
may be delivered to a list of dedicated auditors to inspect them.


Index document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The index document should contain a list of public keys, referring to
all traders engaged in circular transactions. 


Engagement documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each engagement document should contain a public key referring to a
trader, and a list of transaction IDs referring to all circular
transactions in which the particular trader is engaged. 


Circular transaction documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each circular transaction document describes a transaction that should
be carried out by traders as long as it is in accordance with this
whole specification.  Circular transaction documents should contain
the following information:

+ a unique transaction ID
+ transaction value
+ a list of all participating `delivery agreements`_, along with their
  content and the corresponding buyer's and seller's digital
  signatures, ordered according to their successive occurrence in the
  cycle


Resellers
---------

A `reseller` is a trader which resells goods on behalf of other
traders.  Sellers may employ resellers in order to expand the circle
of their potential clients.  Special attention should be paid in
implementations to allow traders to act as resellers.

Here is a incomplete list of activities a reseller may perform:

+ Maintain a database containing information about traders and the
  goods they sell.
+ Set a quality standard for trader's goods.
+ Specify prices for traders' goods.
+ Advertise traders' goods.
+ Store trader's goods
+ Collect fees form traders.
