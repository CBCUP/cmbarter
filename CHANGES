v1.16.2 -- Minor UI fixes.
        -- Minor fixes in docker images.
        -- Minor change in the installation guide.
        -- Use iptables to limit the maximum rate of incoming new
           connections in the "proxy" docker image. This should
           guarantee that the database can not be overloaded -- the
           bottleneck will be the proxy server or the web servers.

June 10th, 2017
v1.16.1 -- Use pgbouncer in "web" docker image.
        -- The "tasks" image responds to SIGTERM.
        -- Improved visual style on hand-held devices.

June 5th, 2017
v1.16.0 -- Support for different password hashing methods.
        -- Increased the default minimum password length to 10.
        -- Minor change in the database schema.
        -- Improved docker support.
        -- Fixed possible leak of sensitive info when replying to emails.
        -- Adopted semantic versioning scheme.

           In the future, when an incompatible change in the database
           schema is made -- the major version number will be
           incremented.

May 25th, 2017
v1.15 -- Added support for Docker.
      -- Uses cookie-based sessions instead of file-based sessions.

September 12th, 2016

      -- Minor updates in the "reCAPTCHA" handlig.

June 28th, 2014
v1.12 -- Minor changes to the installation guide.
      -- Dropped support for Python 2.6.

October 30th, 2013
v1.11 -- Improved the way session files are garbage-collected. This
         closes a potential DoS-attack vector.

October 17th, 2013
v1.10 -- Fixed a serious security problem in the WAP-application.

      -- Disabled "django.middleware.gzip.GZipMiddleware" because of
         the newly discovered "BREACH" attack against Django's CSRF
         protection. For more information check this link:
         https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/aug/06/breach-and-django/

      -- Now CMB automatically maintains a whitelist of IP-addresses.
         Site administrators can use this whitelist to configure their
         firewall to protect their web-server(s) from DoS attacks.

      -- Improved CuriousORM module. Now "CuriousORM" is a separate
         project and has its own repository at
         https://github.com/epandurski/CuriousORM/

      -- Now CMB's source code can be effortlessly transformed to work
         with Python 3. To do this, find all "PYTHON3"-tagged comments
         in the code and make the suggested substitutions. Then run
         "2to3" on the entire source tree. (You may skip
         "curiousorm.py" because it already is Python3 compatible.)

      -- Added "show_whitelist.py" command-line tool.
      -- Added "show_emails.py" command-line tool.
      -- Minor UI improvements.
      -- Minor bug-fixes.
      -- Closed few potential DoS-attack vectors.

       -- Added a pure-python implementation of the AES cipher
          algorithm. It is used when PyCrypto is not available.
       -- Closed a potential DoS-attack vector.
       -- Minor improvements and fixes.

February 26th, 2013
v1.8.5 -- More anti-DoS measures.

          Most importantly, now DoS-attacks against the web-server are
          never propagated to the database server. Therefore it is now
          possible to have several web-servers, exposed to different
          levels of DoS-attack thread, connected to the same database,
          not interfering with each other. That is: An attack on one
          of the web-servers will not overload the database, and
          therefore will have no impact on the other web-servers.

       -- Minor improvements and bug-fixes.

February 15th, 2013
v1.8.4 -- Added "schedule_turns.py" command-line tool. It allows
          administrators to easily change turns' time and period in
          the database.
       -- Minor improvements and bug-fixes.

January 30th, 2013

          use now.

       -- Minor improvements and code refactoring.
       -- Some files have new names.

          the calculation process.

        attacks.
     -- Minor changes to the manual.

September 7th, 2011
v1.4 -- Implemented new product/trader discovery mechanism.

        The idea is that traders can make their list of partners
        publicly available. This way they say: "I trust this guys. I
        checked them out."

        There are 2 ways users can view other users' partners:

        1) They can click on the name of the partner in their partners
        list, then click on the "view trusted traders" link. This way,
        they can view the partners of their partners.

        2) They can use the public search page that is generated for
        every trader. For example:
        https://multiswap.net/search/751181894/?q=alex 
        This search-URL can be used in any third-party website.

     -- Minor changes to the manual.

August 25th, 2011
v1.3.2 -- Fixed a subtle bug allowing traders to issue a hand-crafted
          POST-request so as to remove a product from their price-list

        currencies are not only redeemable by the businesses that
        issued them, but are tradeable via an online marketplace that
        matches currency holders with other tradecredit-backed
        currencies they want.

     -- Minor changes to the manual.
     -- Minor user interface improvements and fixes.

November 22th, 2010
