v1.8.6 -- CMB can work with PyPy now. 
       -- Added a pure-python implementation of the AES cipher
          algorithm. It is used when PyCrypto is not available.
       -- Closed a potential DoS-attack vector.
       -- Minor improvements and fixes.

February 26th, 2013
v1.8.5 -- More anti-DoS measures.

          Most importantly, now DoS-attacks against the web-server are
          never propagated to the database server. Therefore it is now
          possible to have several web-servers, exposed to different
          levels of DoS-attack thread, connected to the same database,
          not interfering with each other. That is: An attack on one
          of the web-servers will not overload the database, and
          therefore will have no impact on the other web-servers.

       -- Minor improvements and bug-fixes.

February 15th, 2013
v1.8.4 -- Added "schedule_turns.py" command-line tool. It allows

v1.4 -- Implemented new product/trader discovery mechanism.

        The idea is that traders can make their list of partners
        publicly available. This way they say: "I trust this guys. I
        checked them out."

        There are 2 ways users can view other users' partners:

        1) They can click on the name of the partner in their partners
        list, then click on the "view trusted traders" link. This way,
        they can view the partners of their partners.

        2) They can use the public search page that is generated for
        every trader. For example:
        https://multiswap.net/search/751181894/?q=alex 
        This search-URL can be used in any third-party website.

        matches currency holders with other tradecredit-backed
        currencies they want.
