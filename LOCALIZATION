1. Install CMB.

2. Make sure you have *gettext* and *python-docutils* software
   packages installed. For example [*]_::
   
     # apt-get install gettext
     ..

     # apt-get install python-docutils
     ..

3. Go to CMB's django directory::
   
     # cd /usr/local/share/cmbarter/cmbarter/

   Further in this manual "es" is used as an example language
   code. **You should replace "es" with your language code
   everywhere!**

4. Generate a *.po* file for your language::

     # django-admin makemessages -l es

   The *.po* file will be created at
   *./locale/YOUR_LANGUAGE_CODE/LC_MESSAGES/*

5. Translate all the messages in the *.po* file. You may use
   *Gtranslator* or *KBabel* to do this.

6. Compile your *.po* file to a message catalog (*.mo*) file::

     # django-admin compilemessages -l es

7. Make a copy of the *../doc/en/* directory to
   *../doc/YOUR_LANGUAGE_CODE/*.

8. Translate the *../doc/YOUR_LANGUAGE_CODE/rst/cmb-manual.txt* file
   in your language. You should pay attention not to violate the
   *reStructuredText* formatting rules!

9. Use the *rst2html* command line tool to create a HTML (with server
   side includes) version of the manual::

     # cd ../doc/es/
     # rst2html --stylesheet=../css/index.css rst/cmb-manual.txt --template=\
     ../css/template.txt index.shtml

10. Add your language to the "LANGUAGES" list in the
    */usr/local/share/cmbarter/cmbarter/settings.py* configuration file.

11. Run your CMB application server with the newly created translation.

12. Set the user interface to your language, sign up, and see if
    everything is translated correctly. If you find some problems, go
    back and improve your translation.

13. Reproduce the usage scenario described in the examples at the
    manual. Take the same screen-shots in your language. Use the
    *GIMP* files in the *gimpfiles* directory to create similar to the
    original diagrams. Copy the translated diagrams at
    *doc/YOUR_LANGUAGE_CODE/diagrams/*. Make sure the names of the
    files remain the same.

14. Copy the "circular trade" diagram from
    *doc/YOUR_LANGUAGE_CODE/diagrams/circular-trade.jpg* to
    *static/circular-trade-YOUR_LANGUAGE_CODE.jpg*.

15. **Do not forget to contribute your translation back to the CMB
    project!**


.. [*] The example given here is for *Debian*. If you use another
   operating system, the exact commands that do the work might be
   different.
